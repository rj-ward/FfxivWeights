## General Information
This is a simple add-on that adds an option to the object menu to complete three tasks that we do on every mod mesh for mods for Final Fantasy XIV:
- Quantizes the Deform Bone weights to 255 steps
- Limits the total Deform Bone weights per vertex to 8
- Normalizes All Deform Bone weights on the mesh

No need to go into weight paint and click through every menu anymore.
